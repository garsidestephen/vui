# Introducing Vooi
Vooi is a javascript / jquery based voice user interface (vui) plugin for websites. Vooi currently only works in the Chrome browser and utilises inbuilt Voice Recognition to derive and implement user intent. Vooi is easy to implement and configure with just a few simple lines of code. For more information on how to implement and use Vooi visit my website at http://www.stephengarside.co.uk/blog/webdev/voice-control-plugin-for-websites-using-javascript/
